                Remember, <span class="standout-text">the line is a lie!</span> The cloud a little less so.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">The cloud does not represent data points, it is a visual representation of the uncertainty
                in the model itself and it underestimates the total uncertainty.
                It only captures the uncertainty of something akin to a population mean, or more precisely the uncertainty
                over the parameters of the deterministic estradiol curve. It does not capture the full distribution of outcomes
                in the population at large. This is bound to change in the future once a better representation of this uncertainty
                gets implemented (which would include the additional population variability around the deterministic curve).
            </p>

            <p class="indent">The emerging consensus is that the pharmacokinetics of estradiol ester depots is highly variable
                and depends on many factors that are not well understood and rarely taken into account.
                Those factors can lead to vastly different outcomes and are not well represented, if at all,
                in the current models. Those include, among others, the ester concentration, the type of oil used,
                the proportion and type of excipients such as benzyl benzoate that are present in the
                formulation, the injection site, whether the depot is injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously,
                the injection depth, individual differences in metabolism, and the presence of other drugs.
                Some of those confounding factors are sometimes captured to an extent in the uncertainty of the models,
                but only when the data is abundant and spans multiple studies done under different conditions.
                This is, of course, generally not the case. Several of those factors also apply to transdermal,
                oral, and sublingual estradiol. I am actively working to improve and generalize the current models
                in ways that will better capture this variability, but ultimately their accuracy and scope will
                always be limited by the data available.

                using data taken from two 2003 studies by Houssain et al. looking at
                twice-weekly Estradot and Menorest patches, and in the drug label of twice-weekly Mylan patches.
                In light of knowledge gathered from self-reported community data, please be advised that both models
                excessively underestimate the uncertainty which should be close to 10 times larger. The models
                will be improved to better reflect this in the future.
                Currently there is no way to change the wearing period of the patch in the interface
                (i.e. they are fixed at 3&frac12; and 7 days) but it is planned for the future.

            <p><strong>Note regarding "inapproprite WPATH regimens" presets</strong>
                <p class="indent">In the WPATH Standards of Care (Appendix C, page S254), several hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens for transfeminine people are listed. However, some of these recommendations might not align with WPATH's own guidelines and could even be harmful. Here's a breakdown of the issues.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Problem with recommended 5-30 mg intramuscular injections every 2 weeks:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The half-life of estradiol valerate and cypionate are approximately 4 and 8 days, respectively. Injecting every 2 weeks requires higher doses and can cause large fluctuations in hormone levels, leading to very high levels shortly after the injection and very 
                            low levels before the next injection. This can cause mood swings and potentially restart testosterone production in the last few days before the next injection.</li>
                        <li>Using the lower dose limit (5 mg every 2 weeks), hormone levels may drop too low for monotherapy after about 7 days, potentially allowing testosterone production to restart, and further down below 100 pg/mL at odds with WPATH's own recommended levels.</li>
                        <li>Using the upper dose limit (30 mg every 2 weeks), hormone levels could spike dangerously high (upwards of 2,000 pg/mL with EV and 1,000 pg/mL with EC), increasing the risk of blood clots for those predisposed to thrombotic events.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem with recommended 2 to 10 mg intramuscular injections every week:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using the lower dose limit (2 mg every week), hormone levels may consistently stay below 150 pg/mL throughout the week with EC and during the second half of the week with EV, and below 100 pg/mL in the last 2 days of the week for both, which might necessitate using an anti-androgen to suppress testosterone.</li>
                        <li>Using the upper dose limit (10 mg every week), hormone levels may consistently stay above 300-400 pg/mL, which is much higher than WPATH’s own recommended levels.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
